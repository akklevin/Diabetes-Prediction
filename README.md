# Diabetes-Prediction

This project focuses on building and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier to predict diabetes outcomes using a dataset from Kaggle. The process includes key machine learning tasks such as data preprocessing, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. The model aims to achieve high accuracy in predicting diabetes, and we explore methods like feature ranking and optimization to further enhance performance.

By the end of this project, we successfully developed a model that provides actionable insights into predicting health outcomes, with a focus on improving accuracy through feature selection.
